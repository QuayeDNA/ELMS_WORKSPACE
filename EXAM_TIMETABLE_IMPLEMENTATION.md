# Exam Timetable Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive exam timetable/schedule management system implementation for ELMS.

## üìä Database Schema Updates

### New Models Added to Prisma Schema

#### 1. **ExamTimetable** Model
- Container for all scheduled exams in an academic period
- Links to: AcademicYear, Semester, AcademicPeriod, Institution, Faculty
- Status workflow: DRAFT ‚Üí PENDING_APPROVAL ‚Üí APPROVED ‚Üí PUBLISHED ‚Üí IN_PROGRESS ‚Üí COMPLETED ‚Üí ARCHIVED
- Approval workflow: NOT_SUBMITTED ‚Üí PENDING ‚Üí APPROVED/REJECTED/REVISION_REQUIRED
- Configuration options: allowOverlaps, autoResolveConflicts, defaultExamDuration
- Statistics tracking: totalExams, totalConflicts, venuesUtilization

#### 2. **ExamTimetableEntry** Model
- Individual scheduled exam within a timetable
- Links to: ExamTimetable, Course, Venue, Exam (optional, created when confirmed)
- Stores: programIds (JSON array), roomIds (JSON array), invigilatorIds (JSON array)
- Scheduling info: examDate, startTime, endTime, duration
- Status: DRAFT, SCHEDULED, CONFIRMED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED, RESCHEDULED
- Conflict tracking: hasConflicts boolean, conflictDetails (JSON)

#### 3. **TimetableConflict** Model

## üîß Backend Implementation

### Types (examTimetable.ts)
Comprehensive TypeScript type definitions including:
- ExamTimetable, ExamTimetableEntry interfaces
- TimetableConflict, TimetableImport interfaces
- Create/Update data transfer objects
- Query parameter types
- Reference types for relations
- Auto-scheduling configuration types
- Export configuration types

### Service Layer (examTimetableService.ts)
Complete business logic implementation:

#### Timetable Operations
- `getTimetables(query)` - Paginated list with filtering
- `getTimetableById(id)` - Single timetable with full details
- `createTimetable(data)` - Create with validation
- `updateTimetable(id, data)` - Update with constraints
- `deleteTimetable(id)` - Delete if eligible
- `publishTimetable(id, userId)` - Publish to students
- `submitForApproval(id)` - Submit for review
- `approveTimetable(id, userId)` - Approve timetable
- `rejectTimetable(id, reason)` - Reject with reason
- `getTimetableStatistics(id)` - Comprehensive stats

#### Entry Operations
- `getTimetableEntries(query)` - Filter and paginate entries
- `getTimetableEntryById(id)` - Single entry with relations
- `createTimetableEntry(data)` - Create with validation
- `updateTimetableEntry(id, data)` - Update with checks
- `deleteTimetableEntry(id)` - Delete if allowed

#### Conflict Management
- `detectConflicts(timetableId)` - Comprehensive conflict detection
- `getTimetableConflicts(timetableId)` - List conflicts with summary
- `resolveConflict(conflictId, userId)` - Mark conflict as resolved

#### Utility Functions
- `updateTimetableStats(timetableId)` - Recalculate statistics
- Validates: course-program relationships, venue-room relationships, time slots, capacity

### Controller Layer (examTimetableController.ts)
Request/response handling for all operations:
- Parameter validation
- Authentication checks
- Error handling with appropriate status codes
- Consistent API response format

### Routes
Three route files for clean organization:
1. **examTimetableRoutes.ts** - Main timetable management
2. **timetableEntryRoutes.ts** - Individual entry operations
3. **timetableConflictRoutes.ts** - Conflict resolution

## üì° API Endpoints

## üîê Security & Validation

### Access Control
- All endpoints require authentication
- Role-based permissions (to be implemented)
- User context tracked for audit trail

### Data Validation
- Required field checks
- Date range validation (start < end)
- Academic period consistency
- Course-program relationship validation
- Venue-room relationship validation
- Capacity checks
- Time slot validation
- Timetable state constraints (can't edit published timetables)

### Conflict Detection
Automatic detection of:
- Student scheduling conflicts (same student, overlapping exams)
- Venue conflicts (same room, same time)
- Invigilator conflicts (same person, multiple locations)
- Capacity violations (students > seats)
- Time/date violations (outside allowed ranges)

## üìä Data Flow

1. Create timetable container (DRAFT status)
2. Add entries (validate each)
3. Detect conflicts automatically
4. Submit for approval
5. Admin approves
6. Publish to students
