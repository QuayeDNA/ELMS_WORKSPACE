## üîë Collection Features

### Authentication
- **Bearer Token**: Collection-level authentication
- **Variable**: `{{authToken}}` auto-set after login
- **Refresh**: Automatic token refresh endpoints included

### Auto-ID Capture
The collection automatically captures and stores IDs from creation endpoints:

```javascript
// Example: After creating an institution
pm.collectionVariables.set('institutionId', response.data.id);
```

**Captured Variables** (22 total):
- `institutionId`, `facultyId`, `departmentId`, `programId`, `programPrefixId`
- `courseId`, `studentId`, `instructorId`, `userId`

### Request Body Templates
All POST/PUT endpoints include realistic sample data:
```json
{
  "name": "University of Example",
  "code": "UE",
  "type": "PUBLIC",
  "country": "Example Country"
}
```

### Role-Based Access Control
Each endpoint documented with required roles:

## üìù Inventory Corrections

During collection creation, the following discrepancies were found and corrected:

| Module | Inventory Claim | Actual Count | Difference |
|--------|----------------|--------------|------------|
| Instructors | 14 endpoints | 13 endpoints | -1 |
| Incidents | 13 endpoints | 12 endpoints | -1 |
| **TOTAL** | **157 claimed** | **166 actual** | **+9** |

**Explanation**:
- Inventory document (`COMPLETE_API_ENDPOINTS_INVENTORY.md`) had incorrect counts for Instructors and Incidents
- All endpoint counts verified against actual route files in `backend/src/routes/`
- Collection contains **166 endpoints** based on implemented backend routes

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Gaps

The following modules are listed in the original inventory but **NOT yet implemented in backend**:

| Module | Planned Endpoints | Status |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| Semester Records | 8 | ‚ùå Backend route file missing |
| Academic History | 10 | ‚ùå Backend route file missing |
| Course Offerings | 8 | ‚ùå Backend route file missing |
| Enrollments | 7 | ‚ùå Backend route file missing |
| Grades/Assessments | 6 | ‚ùå Backend route file missing |

**Total Missing**: ~39 endpoints

These modules are critical for a complete ELMS system and should be implemented in the backend before adding to this collection.

- [ ] Enrollments (student enrollment tracking)
- [ ] Grades/Assessments (grade submission system)
- [ ] Semester Records (GPA calculation)
- [ ] Academic History (transcript generation)

### 3. Advanced Features
- [ ] Timetable management
- [ ] Attendance tracking
- [ ] Reports generation
- [ ] Notifications system
- [ ] File upload endpoints

### 4. Integration Testing
- [ ] Test complete registration workflow
- [ ] Test exam scheduling to incident reporting
- [ ] Test prerequisite validation during registration
- [ ] Test academic calendar workflow
