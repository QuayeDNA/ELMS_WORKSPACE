## üîê Authentication Setup

### Step 1: Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

The server should start on `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 2: Login to Get Auth Token

The collection includes 5 login requests for different user roles:

1. **Super Admin** - `admin@elms.com` / `Admin@123`
2. **Institution Admin** - `admin@git.edu.gh` / `password123`
3. **Faculty Admin (Dean)** - `dean.engineering@git.edu.gh` / `password123`
4. **Lecturer** - `james.lecturer@git.edu.gh` / `password123`
5. **Student** - `alice.student@st.git.edu.gh` / `password123`

**To Login:**
1. Navigate to `0. Authentication` folder
2. Select a login request (e.g., "Login - Super Admin")
3. Click **Send**
4. The auth token will be **automatically saved** to the collection variable `{{authToken}}`

### Step 3: Verify Token is Set

1. Click on the collection name in the left sidebar
2. Go to **Variables** tab
3. You should see `authToken` with a value

   - Verify response before moving to next

---

## üìù Notes

- All endpoints require authentication except login
- Token is automatically included via collection-level auth
- Some endpoints require specific roles (check descriptions)
- Variables are automatically saved by test scripts where possible
- Update manual variables before testing dependent endpoints

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Start

2. Ensure backend is running (`npm run dev`)
3. Run "Login - Super Admin" request
4. Start testing endpoints in order
5. Check off completed items in the checklist above
