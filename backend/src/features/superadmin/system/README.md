# System Administration Feature

## Overview
The System Administration feature provides comprehensive system management capabilities for Super Admin users, enabling them to configure, monitor, and maintain the ELMS platform effectively.

## Key Features

### 1. Configuration Management
- **System Settings**: Manage platform-wide configuration categories including general, security, email, authentication, database, storage, notifications, integrations, performance, and maintenance settings
- **Category-Based Organization**: Configurations are organized into logical categories for easier management
- **Validation Support**: Built-in validation for configuration changes to ensure system stability

### 2. System Health Monitoring
- **Real-time Health Checks**: Monitor the health status of all system components
- **Component-Specific Monitoring**: Track individual components like database, cache, services, and external integrations
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed system performance indicators and resource utilization
- **Customizable Monitoring**: Configure which components to monitor and the level of detail

### 3. Database Operations
- **Operation Management**: Execute and monitor database operations including backup, restore, migration, maintenance, optimization, cleanup, reindex, and vacuum
- **Scheduled Operations**: Support for scheduling database operations at optimal times
- **Operation Tracking**: Monitor the status and progress of database operations
- **Table-Specific Operations**: Target specific tables for focused maintenance

### 4. Cache Management
- **Multi-Target Caching**: Manage different cache targets including user sessions, API responses, database queries, and static assets
- **Cache Operations**: Support for clear, flush, rebuild, and analyze cache operations
- **Performance Statistics**: Detailed cache performance metrics and usage statistics
- **Pattern-Based Management**: Use patterns to target specific cache entries

### 5. Maintenance Scheduling
- **Maintenance Windows**: Schedule and manage system maintenance windows
- **Multiple Maintenance Types**: Support for scheduled, emergency, preventive, and corrective maintenance
- **Task Management**: Break down maintenance into specific tasks with time estimates
- **Service Impact Tracking**: Track which services are affected during maintenance
- **User Notifications**: Optional user notifications for scheduled maintenance

## API Endpoints

### Configuration Management
- `GET /configuration/categories` - Get available configuration categories
- `GET /configuration` - Get all system configurations
- `GET /configuration/:category` - Get configuration for specific category
- `PUT /configuration/:category` - Update configuration for specific category

### System Health
- `GET /health` - Get comprehensive system health status

### Database Operations
- `GET /database/operation-types` - Get available database operation types
- `POST /database/operations` - Execute database operation
- `GET /database/operations/:operationId` - Get database operation status

### Cache Management
- `GET /cache/targets` - Get available cache targets
- `GET /cache/statistics` - Get cache performance statistics
- `POST /cache/manage` - Execute cache management operations

### Maintenance Management
- `GET /maintenance` - Get maintenance windows
- `POST /maintenance` - Schedule new maintenance window

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Initialize the System Administration feature
import { initializeSystemAdministration } from './features/superadmin/system/system-administration.feature';

const systemAdmin = initializeSystemAdministration(prisma, redis);

// Use in Express app
app.use('/api/superadmin/system', systemAdmin.routes);
```

## Security Considerations
- All endpoints require Super Admin authentication and authorization
- Configuration changes are validated before application
- Database operations are logged and monitored
- Maintenance operations include safety checks and rollback capabilities

## Performance Features
- Efficient caching strategies for frequently accessed configurations
- Optimized database queries for system health monitoring
- Background processing for long-running maintenance operations
- Real-time status updates for ongoing operations

## Integration Points
- **Authentication System**: Integrates with existing Super Admin authentication
- **Logging System**: All operations are logged for audit purposes
- **Notification System**: Maintenance notifications and system alerts
- **Monitoring Stack**: Health metrics integration with system monitoring tools
