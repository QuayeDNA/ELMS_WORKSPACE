## 📝 Notes for Single Developer

### Keep It Simple
- Start with MVP features only
- Add complexity gradually
- Focus on working software over perfect architecture
- Use proven technologies over experimental ones

### Development Principles
- **Convention over Configuration**: Use standard patterns
- **Progress over Perfection**: Working features > perfect code
- **Documentation**: Keep simple docs as you build
- **Testing**: Focus on critical paths, don't over-test

### Scope Management
- **Phase-based Development**: Complete one phase before starting next
- **Feature Freeze**: Resist adding new features until current phase is complete
- **User Feedback**: Get feedback early and often from actual users
