# NPM "Lock Compromised" Error - Resolution Guide

## Problem
When trying to install the shadcn skeleton component, you encountered:
```
npm error code ECOMPROMISED
npm error Lock compromised
```

## What This Means
This error indicates that npm detected an integrity issue with the `package-lock.json` file. This can happen when:
- The lock file gets corrupted
- Multiple npm versions were used
- File system issues during package installation
- Incomplete or interrupted installations

## Solution Applied

### Step 1: Clean Up Corrupted Files
```powershell
# Remove corrupted package-lock.json
Remove-Item package-lock.json -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Remove node_modules (optional but recommended)
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force
```

### Step 2: Reinstall Dependencies
```powershell
# This creates a fresh package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Step 3: Work Around npx Issues
Since `npx shadcn@latest` still had issues, we installed shadcn globally:
```powershell
# Install shadcn CLI globally
npm install -g shadcn@latest

# Use the global installation
shadcn add skeleton
```

## Result
✅ **Successfully installed** `skeleton.tsx` component
- Location: `src/components/ui/skeleton.tsx`
- Now available for import in all pages

## Files Updated
1. **AcademicYearsPage.tsx** - Added Skeleton import
2. **SemestersPage.tsx** - Added Skeleton import and loading skeletons
3. **AcademicPeriodsPage.tsx** - Already had Skeleton import

## Prevention
To avoid this issue in the future:
1. **Use consistent npm version** - Don't mix npm, yarn, pnpm
2. **Commit package-lock.json** - Keep it in version control
3. **Don't manually edit package-lock.json** - Let npm manage it
4. **Use `npm ci`** in CI/CD - It's stricter about lock file integrity

## Alternative Solutions (If Problem Persists)

### Option 1: Update npm
```powershell
npm install -g npm@latest
```

### Option 2: Use Different Package Manager
```powershell
# Install pnpm (alternative)
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install

# Or use yarn
npm install -g yarn
yarn install
```

### Option 3: Delete and Recreate Lock File
```powershell
Remove-Item package-lock.json
Remove-Item -Recurse node_modules
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

## Current Status
✅ Problem resolved
✅ Skeleton component installed
✅ All academic pages updated with proper loading states
✅ Project ready for development

## Note on Warnings
The warnings during `npm install` about cleanup failures are **safe to ignore**:
```
npm warn cleanup Failed to remove some directories
```
These are just temporary file permission issues with native binary files (lightningcss, tailwindcss-oxide) and don't affect functionality.
